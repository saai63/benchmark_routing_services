# Benchmark Routing Service Providers

## Motivation
Ola [recently launched it's own mapping services](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7215988881886699521?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7215988881886699521%29) and I wanted to benchmark the performance of Ola's maps against other service providers. This is a humble attempt at that. 
The framework can be further extended to benchmark other services such as Search, MapDisplay tiles etc.,
